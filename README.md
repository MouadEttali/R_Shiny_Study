# R_Shiny_Study


R shiny Project with univariate and bivariate data analysis using the HR-Employee Attrition datasets along with a binary classification using Lasso logistic regression,
where we predict if employees are going to churn or not based on multiple variables in the data.sss
I trained the model and saved it in a notebook, then loaded it into my shiny web app.
